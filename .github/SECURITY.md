## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security very seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us immediately.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by:

1.  **Opening an Issue:** Create a new issue in this repository.  Clearly describe the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it, and the potential impact.  Use the `Bug Report` template and mention "Security Vulnerability" in the title.
2.  **Email (Optional):** If you prefer, you can also email the maintainers directly.  Please look for the maintainer contact information in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or the project's documentation.  Provide the same level of detail as you would in an issue.

### What to Include in Your Report

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Describe the type of vulnerability (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection, buffer overflow).
*   **Affected Code:** Identify the specific files or code sections where the vulnerability exists.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:** Provide detailed steps that allow us to reproduce the vulnerability. Include any specific input, configurations, or actions required.
*   **Expected Behavior:** Explain what should happen instead of the vulnerability.
*   **Actual Behavior:** Describe the actual behavior or the outcome of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Explain the potential impact of the vulnerability. How could it be exploited?  What could an attacker achieve?
*   **Proof of Concept (Optional):** If possible, provide a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.

### Response Time

We will acknowledge your report as quickly as possible. We aim to respond within 48 hours.  We will investigate the vulnerability and work to fix it as soon as possible.

### Our Commitment

*   We will work to verify and address the vulnerability promptly.
*   We will keep you informed of our progress.
*   We may request additional information if needed.
*   We will credit you in the release notes or security advisory if you report a valid vulnerability and wish to be acknowledged.

## Security Best Practices

We are committed to building secure software. We follow these security best practices:

*   **Input Validation:** We validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQLi).
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** We implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive resources.
*   **Data Encryption:** We encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** We conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** We regularly update our dependencies to address security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   **Code Reviews:** We conduct code reviews to identify and address security issues.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:** We follow secure coding practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
*   **Zero Trust Principles:** We apply Zero Trust principles.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the latest version of the project.  We encourage users to keep their installations up to date.

## Disclosure Policy

We will publicly disclose security vulnerabilities after a fix has been released and users have had a reasonable amount of time to update their installations.  We will provide a security advisory with details about the vulnerability, the affected versions, and the recommended fix.

## Contact

For any security-related questions or concerns, please contact the maintainers. You can find contact information in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file or the project's documentation.
